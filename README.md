# Paused, waning or abandoned projects
This personal folder is for my projects which are in the 'paused', 'waning' or 'abandoned' states.<br>
Go [here](https://github.com/8BtS-P-to-Ab) for project list.
- Definitions:
  - Paused: Work on the project is temporarily stopped (usually due to an issue, lack of recources) with some chance of it being continued. Don't expect maintenance on the project.
  
  - Waning: Work on the project is in an unknown state and is effectively stopped with an unknown chance of being continued. Don't expect maintenance  on the project.
  
  - Abandoned: Work on the project is indefinitely stopped with very little chance of it being continued, but it may be picked back up in the future. Don't expect anything. (usually due to there being not enough resources available to maintain without hindering other active projects' quality.)
